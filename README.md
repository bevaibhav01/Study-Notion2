#Project Description
StudyNotion is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume,
and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes
ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS.
StudyNotion aims to provide:
– A seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education
more accessible and engaging.
– A platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners
across the globe.
In the following sections, we will cover the technical details of the platform, including:
1. System architecture: The high-level overview of the platform's components and
diagrams of the architecture.
2. Front-end: The description of the front-end architecture, user interface design,
features, and functionalities of the front-end, and frameworks, libraries, and tools
used.
3. Back-end: The description of the back-end architecture, features and functionalities of
the back-end, frameworks, libraries, tools used, and data models and database schema.
4. API Design: The description of the API design, list of API endpoints, their
functionalities, and sample API requests and responses.
5. Deployment: The description of the deployment process, hosting environment and
infrastructure, and deployment scripts and configuration.
6. Testing: The description of the testing process, types of testing, test frameworks and
tools used.
7. Future Enhancements: The list of potential future enhancements to the platform,
explanation of how these enhancements would improve the platform, estimated
timeline and priority for implementing these enhancements.
In summary, StudyNotion is a versatile and intuitive ed-tech platform that is designed to
provide an immersive learning experience to students and a platform for instructors to
showcase their expertise. In the following sections, we will delve into the technical details
of the platform, which will provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform's
features and functionalities.

System Architecture
The StudyNotion ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the
back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the
front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.
Front-end
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library
for building user interfaces. ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user
interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students.
The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.
Back-end
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which are popular
frameworks for building scalable and robust server-side applications. The back end
provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user
authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the
logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.
Database
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that
provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of
unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing course content such as
videos, images, and PDFs. The database stores the course content, user data, and other
relevant information related to the platform.

Front-end
The front end is part of the platform that the user interacts with. It's like the "face" of the
platform that the user sees and interacts with. The front end of StudyNotion is designed
using a tool called Figma, which is a popular design tool that allows for the creation of
clean and minimal user interfaces.
The front end of StudyNotion has all the necessary pages that an ed-tech platform should
have. Some of these pages are:
For Students:
– Homepage: This page will have a brief introduction to the platform, as well as links
to the course list and user details.
– Course List: This page will have a list of all the courses available on the platform,
along with their descriptions and ratings.
– Wishlist: This page will display all the courses that a student has added to their
wishlist.
– Cart Checkout: This page will allow the user to complete the course purchase.
– Course Content: This page will have the course content for a particular course,
including videos, and other related material.
– User Details: This page will have details about the student's account, including
their name, email, and other relevant information.
– User Edit Details: This page will allow the student to edit their account details.
ForInstructors:
– Dashboard: This page will have an overview of the instructor's courses, as well as
the ratings and feedback for each course.
– Insights: This page will have detailed insights into the instructor's courses,
including the number of views, clicks, and other relevant metrics.
– Course Management Pages: These pages will allow the instructor to create, update,
and delete courses, as well as manage the course content and pricing.
– View and Edit Profile Details: These pages will allow the instructor to view and edit
their account details
